        # ALGORITHM:
        #
        # The process for transforming a point from a source frame to a
        # destination frame is as follows:
        #
        # * First, transform the point from the source frame into the base
        #   frame. This can be accomplished by walking up the tree from the
        #   source frame to the base frame and performing each transform as
        #   it is encountered.
        #
        # * Second, transform the point from the base frame to the
        #   destination frame.  This can be accomplished by walking DOWN the
        #   tree from the base frame to the destination frame, multiplying by
        #   the INVERSE (np.linalg.inv) of each transformation matrix that is
        #   encountered .  (If matrix T transforms from A to B then T^-1
        #   tranforms from B to A.)
        #
        # Note that it isn't actually practical to walk *down* the tree
        # from the base to a particular node: each node may have multiple
        # children, and there is no way, other than a brute-force search, to
        # know which one should be selected. Instead you should collect all
        # of the transforms while walking UP the tree, and then reverse the
        # order before applying the (inverted) transforms.
        #
        # Feel free to create helper methods as needed.
